Benchmark slowed spectra against MULASSIS SPENVIS output
Instead of lots of simulations, write a single long simulation in TRIM.in
    WONTFIX TRIM.IN doesn't support multiple lines of input and TRIM.dat requires human intervention to run :(
Write a simulation class to simplify integration into other code
Make plots of accumulated damage vs incident energy to figure out when the low-energy protons start to really matter.
Make option to read CSV the specifies the shield stack
    WONTFIX need to know displacement energy, lattice energy, and surface energy, which aren't available from Compound.dat
